# Save data from wikipedia for each concept and its genus. 
# If the page doesn't exist or is very short, use its ancestor's wiki page (excluding 1st paragraph), replacing the ancestor name with the concept name
# Sanitize the concept names (eg. "Acanthascinae sp. 1-4 complex", "Cirrata \"egg\"", "Holothuroidea/Actiniaria", "Polychelidae 2", "Spongosorites (right)", "Uroptychus n.", "Aspidodiadema cf. hawaiiense")
# What to do with cases like "1-gallon paint bucket" if there's no wiki page? Ignore them? Use the last word (eg. "bucket", "laser")?
